# The Gate Keepers Game

This is a simple interview game that I created to help me practice for my first job as a penetration tester. I hope it can also assist others who are aspiring to start their career or just help in applying for a different company. Please keep in mind that I'm not a professional developer, so the code may not be perfect. This was my very first program, and it helped me practice my basic Python skills.

## Purpose

The objective of this game is to provide practice for typical (and some unusual) questions that HR might ask during an interview. The questions provided in this game are sourced from various websites mentioned below, but feel free to add your own personalized questions and roles if desired.
Remember: Don't be afraid to apply for a job you feel unqualified for â€“ you might just surprise yourself and be the most qualified candidate.

## Usage

Just clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/MosquitoHunt3r/TheGateKeepers.git` and run `python3 TheGateKeepers.py` from within the cloned directory.

I plan on adding more roles and questions to the game in the future. Meanwhile, you have the option to add a custom role when starting the game. You will be prompted to provide the name of the file containing questions and answers. Make sure the Q&A file is located in the same directory as the `TheGateKeepers.py` script. The file should follow the following syntax:

	[question][? or .]:[answer]

For example:

	Who was Darth Vader before given this name?:A Jedi named Anakin Skywalker
	Explain what a bee is.:It's a small insect that flies
