What is the main purpose of pen-testing?:Performing a "deep dive" into a company's or organization's IT infrastructure is the major goal of a pentest, with the primary objective being to get access to any (and, if possible, all) of the available electronic-based assets. It is vital to remember that the purpose of the pentester isn't just to attempt to strike a hard blow straightaway at the very beginning; rather, they raise the power of the cyber-attack over a timeframe. 
Have you worked on the different pentest teams?:When migrating our systems to a cloud server, we performed penetration testing to evaluate security risks. I worked on the red team, so I had to act as the hacker. I created several scenarios where I thought we were most vulnerable. Working with the purple team, who had extensive knowledge of both threats and protection, they provided information about how the blue team planned to address attacks, so I thought of different injection methods where they might lack preparation.
What types of malware have you found when testing?:The most common malware I've experienced has been quickly spreading viruses, trojans and spyware. When I worked for a financial company, we commonly saw spyware attacks to gain credentials and sensitive information from our databases. I often posed as a spyware threat to test our system safety and provided regular updates where we might perform security patches.
Define Information Security?:The practice of protecting information from unwanted access is known as information security. This word can be defined as information availability, integrity, and confidentiality preservation. Notably, additional qualities can also be relevant, including accountability, authenticity, non-repudiation, and reliability.
Define pen testing in your own words.:Companies utilize a sort of testing called pen testing to find and stop security problems. This aids businesses in proactively managing risks in their networks, systems, and programs through a variety of techniques.
Explain Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption.:First, encryption modifies the sequence in which data appears from its original format to prevent access from those without the necessary authorization. One passkey is used for both encryption and decryption in symmetric encryption. In such instances, the owner and end-user use the identical key and can encrypt and decode the data using the same password. Owners of the software have a private pass key, and end users have a public pass key in asymmetric encryption. This is done to separate high-level data from the available data that the general public cannot access.
What is "Vulnerability"?:Every information security professional wants to get rid of the word "vulnerability" from the IT system. A system might be compromised intentionally or unintentionally if certain vulnerabilities were to be exploited.
What's most important in data protection?:To prevent unwanted assaults on our databases, I believe it is crucial to have advanced network security measures. Since threats can occasionally be unavoidable, intrusion detection systems might even be more vital. These tools can support businesses in swiftly responding to risks and routinely monitoring safety.
What is the motive for conducting a pen testing exercise?:The motives are as follows: To assess adherence to the security policies that the business has created and executed; To evaluate an employee's proactivity and understanding of the security environment they are in.; To completely understand the potential impact of a significant security breach on a business organization, as well as how soon they can respond to it and resume regular business activities after being affected.
Define the term Intrusion Detection.:The process of identifying an external force attempting to get access to the software which is unauthorized is known as intrusion detection. As the name suggests, any sort of unauthorized access is reported as soon as it’s found so that the appropriate actions can be taken to stop the incursion. It is similar to when some burglary gets detected and found and then an alert is set off by the technology. The business shall check the software's intrusion detection technology automatically during penetration testing to ensure it’s operating properly.
The terms "pen-testing" and "vulnerability testing" are frequently used hand in hand. What distinguishes the two in particular?:With the aid of vulnerability testing, one is merely searching for any potential flaws in any IT infrastructure component. In a pentest, a full-scale cyberattack or series of cyberattacks are launched with the client's (or the requester's) express consent to identify any weaknesses that the IT security team has not yet identified.
What kind of penetration is possible with the Diffie Hellman exchange?:One of the first public-key protocols was the Diffie-Hellman key exchange (DH), which allows users to safely exchange cryptographic keys across a public channel. With the help of this technology, poor ephemeral Diffie-Hellman parameters in detecting SSL/TLS services can be accomplished.
Describe data packet sniffing?:The method of examining network traffic to spot any odd activities or unauthorized users is known as data packet sniffing. With this, we could continuously watch over the security of our networks. I would examine the data for any new threats to see if we could identify the source or perpetrators.
What Are the Possible Causes of Security Vulnerabilities?:The software may be deemed vulnerable for a number of different reasons. Determining the degree of a software vulnerability is often the responsibility of penetration testers. Programming mistakes can leave software open to attack. The software can be made vulnerable through improper private and public encryption. Not having sufficient intrusion detection systems and insufficient surveillance equipment. The software can be deemed insecure if its data are not sufficiently backed up or safeguarded.
Why is it necessary for us to stay within the pen test scope?:Proper scoping can help get rid of problems. The scope of a penetration test can also affect how well it goes by affecting how many issues are avoided. Simply said, a penetration test's scope informs the test team which objects can be targeted and examined.
What are the different encryption types?:Symmetric and asymmetric encryption are the two main types. Using keys, symmetric encryption means users and information owners can use the same key to encrypt or decrypt information. Assymetric means there's a private and public key to increase data protection for more sensitive information.
What makes a system vulnerable?:Systems and programs are most vulnerable if they don't have additional security features like firewalls or advanced encryptions. In my last role, I pentested each new program we required, as they often lacked security features. This helped us identify what security measures we could implement to protect data.
What's your process when pentesting?:First, I evaluate the software that requires testing to decide which technique to use. In my previous role, I primarily performed web application testing, where I would spend a lot of time with reconnaissance and scanning to identify any vulnerabilities. Once complete, I'd investigate what data was vulnerable and try to hack as much as possible. With this information, we could decide on the risk level and implement security measures.
Have you used different pentesting methodologies?:I've used all three methodologies, black-box, white-box and gray-box testing. We mostly performed gray-box testing for our legacy systems with many security controls, but I often performed black-box testing with no prior knowledge for new software applications.
Could you describe XSS?:During my testing, I would perform stored XSS to see if our customers were vulnerable to these attacks. During one test, I found I could inject malware onto our contact site, gathering customer data each time someone submitted a form. We added a firewall to that site along with malicious file detection to prevent similar attacks and receive notifications if any threat breached the site again.
What's most important in data protection?:I think strong network security protections are important to guard against malicious attacks against our databases. Even more important might be intrusion detection systems, as sometimes threats are inevitable. These systems can help companies respond to threats quickly and monitor safety regularly.
Do you have similar experience in risk analysis?:I started my career as a risk analyst for an advertising company. In this role, I learned the foundations of cybersecurity and the possible threats a company might experience. I worked with designers to evaluate potential risks when coding new products, advising on the probability we might experience a malicious attack to improve security measures.
What are some of the common abbreviations?:Abbreviations were common in testing and communication at my past jobs. We used terms like 2FA, two-factor authentication, 2VPCP, or two-version priority ceiling protocol and 3DESEP, or triple data encryption standard encryption protocol. I also became familiar with less technical acronyms, like STRIDE, to describe the common threat modeling techniques.
Do you have any certifications in this area?:I have two certifications in the field, the PNPT by TCM Security and an OSCP certificate. These helped me learn about some of the most common tools and techniques used by hackers. With this knowledge, I provided my organizations with additional considerations when enabling and maintaining security features for our programs.
What is data packet sniffing?:Data packet sniffing is the technique of investigating network traffic to identify any strange activity or unauthorized users. I typically used Wireshark software to perform these actions. At my last job, we would regularly monitor our networks to ensure regular safety. With any new threats, I'd analyze the data to see if we could understand the origins or attackers.
What is XPath Injection in penetration testing?:XPath injection is a type of vulnerability in which malicious input is used to inject unintended commands into an XML document. This can be done by injecting any user-supplied string directly into an XPath expression, or even by using specially crafted elements and attributes. Injection attacks are one of the most common methods used to exploit software vulnerabilities because they allow attackers to run arbitrary code as part of the attack payload.
Explain Web Application Scanning with w3af in pen-testing?:w3af is versatile and can be used for a number of purposes in pen-testing. For example, it can be used to identify vulnerabilities in web applications before conducting a full attack, to check for signs of malware and phishing attacks, and to monitor for security issues. In addition, w3af can be used to identify vulnerabilities in outdated or insecure web applications. 
Explain reflected XSS Vulnerability.:Reflected XSS vulnerability occurs when data entered in a web form is accessed by an unpatched web browser and interpreted by the application. The data entered in the form is then displayed on the web page as if it was coming from the user’s web browser. This vulnerability is exploited when an attacker sends a specially crafted input to a web form that is then reflected in the web page. This allows the attacker to inject malicious code into the web page and to run the code without being detected.
What is Hijacking Execution in pen-testing?:Hijacking execution in penetration testing is a technique that attackers use to gain access to systems or networks. Hijacking execution takes advantage of the privileges and permissions granted to an intruder by default on compromised machines, which can then be used for malicious purposes. Attackers may also leverage user accounts created specifically for reconnaissance or attack tasks, as well as preexisting administrative rights on target machines. By taking advantage of these vulnerabilities, hijackers can bypass common security controls and compromise systems without being detected.
Write a few points about SEH Overwrite Exploits?:SEH Overwrite Exploits are a type of security exploit that allows an attacker to execute code on a target system in memory, even if the target process has normal read, write, and execute permissions; These exploits take advantage of security vulnerabilities in the operating system or application; They can be used to run malicious code on a targeted system, steal data, or implant malware; A lot of remote code execution (RCE) exploits are available for the Server Executable Hypervisor, or SEH.
What is POP POP RET in penetration testing?:POP POP RET is a tool that can be used to detect and exploit vulnerable applications. To use this tool, you will first need to scan the target network for vulnerable applications. Once you have identified the vulnerable applications, you can use POP POP RET to exploit them. By exploiting the vulnerabilities, you can gain access to the systems and data that are protected by the vulnerable applications.
What is meant by DNS Reconnaissance in penetration testing?:When we conduct a penetration test, the most important task is understanding the internal network structure and DNS configuration. This is done through various forms of DNS reconnaissance, also known as DNS sniffing. DNS reconnaissance can be used to gather information about hosts and name servers, as well as their associated configuration. This can include things such as the type of DNS server used, the name server addresses, the primary and secondary name servers, and the A, AAAA, and CNAME records.
What are porting public exploits?:Porting public exploits is a process by which an attacker takes advantage of vulnerabilities in public applications or systems so that they can be used to exploit other vulnerable systems. Porting means taking the exploits and making them work on different versions of the application, system, operating system, etc. It could also mean adopting these exploits to carry out attacks against new targets or finding alternative ways to deliver payloads from the exploited target(s). Port scanning is a reconnaissance technique employed during exploitation whereby attacking computers are scanned for open ports using network protocols.
What is XAMPP?:XAMPP is a completely free and open-source development platform for hosting websites, accessible through a web browser. It is an easy-to-use platform that has a lot of features for web developers. It also has a variety of modules and templates that make it easy to set up a website. Moreover, XAMPP can be used for creating databases, e-commerce solutions, and more. This is also useful for penetration testers, it can be used in web application testing.
What is SSL Stripping in penetration testing?:SSL Stripping is a process that removes the SSL/TLS encryption from an HTTP request before it is sent to the webserver. This allows an attacker to view and modify the data that is being sent in cleartext.SSL stripping can be used by attackers as part of a denial-of-service attack or for other nefarious purposes such as spying on user activity.
What is John the ripper tool and how penetration testers are using it?:John the Ripper is a computer security tool used by penetration testers to test the security of a computer system. It is a command-line tool that can be used to test the security of various file formats. It can also be used to extract data from a target computer.
What is token Impersonation?:In penetration testing, token impersonation is a technique that is used to gain access to resources or systems that are protected by authentication methods such as passwords or tokens. Token impersonation is used to access these resources by pretending to be someone other than the user who is supposed to be accessing them. Token Impersonation can also be used as part of social engineering attacks or phishing exercises.
What is Pass the Hash in penetration testing?:Pass the Hash is a popular cyber security testing practice used to find vulnerable systems and test whether they can be exploited by attackers. It works like an attacker tries different passwords on a target system in order to see if any of them are valid – or, more accurately, triggers the authentication process required for access to that system. By doing this, the tester can then gain access to the account without having to actually break into the system.
What is SSHExec?:SSHExec is a remote shell interface implemented in the SSH protocol. It allows an attacker to run commands on the target machine over SSH without having to be physically present on that system. SSHExec works by establishing a connection between the attacker’s system and the target system. Once the connection is established, the attacker can run commands or scripts on the target system.
What are Socks4a and Proxy Chains?:A socks4a and proxy chains are two types of network analysis tools that are used for penetration testing. socks4a works as a proxy and can intercept packets leaving and entering your targeted systems. It can be used to map the flows of traffic and can be used to examine protocols and handshake data. On the other hand, proxy chains can be used to combine socks4a with various command-line tools to perform various actions on the proxy such as injecting packets, capturing packets, and mangling packets.
What is Local File Inclusion (LFI)?:Local file inclusion (LFI) is a technique used by attackers to include malicious files in the request packets sent to vulnerable systems. This can allow an attacker to access privileged information, or even execute arbitrary code on the target system. LFI vulnerabilities are particularly prevalent in web applications and can be exploited remotely by attacking users who visit affected websites. By including specially crafted requests within HTTP requests, an attacker can inject scripts into pages served up by the application, giving them full control over those pages and any data stored within them.
What is Remote File Inclusion (RFI)?:Remote File Inclusion (RFI) is an exploit technique used in penetration testing whereby a malicious user includes files on the target server that are not actually part of the web application or system being tested. These files can be stored anywhere, but they must exist outside of the document root. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary script code into pages served up by vulnerable servers – potentially allowing them to steal data, execute commands as privileged users or even take over entirely compromised systems.
Explain Leveraging XSS with the Browser Exploitation Framework?:Exploiting XSS in web applications is a common technique used by hackers. XSS, or Cross-Site Scripting, is an attack where a malicious user injects scripts into a website to inject malicious code into the user’s browser. These scripts can inject any script or HTML into a document, which when viewed by a user, can execute without their consent or knowledge. Browser Exploitation Framework (BFX) is a tool used by hackers to exploit XSS in web applications.
What is War-FTP?:War-FTP is a program used in penetration testing which allows users to FTP through an insecure network. FTP is an application used to transfer files between computers. War-FTP is a command-line tool and can be used for emulators such as Wireshark, Carrier Grade NAT (CGNAT), or TAP devices.
What is the method of Finding the Attack String in Memory?:An attack string is important in understanding the process of finding an attack string in memory. An attack string is a set of characters that can be used to breach the security of a system. The term is used in many different ways, but the important thing is that it is a set of characters that can be used to violate the security of a system.
What is Data Execution Prevention in penetration testing?:Data Execution Prevention, or DEP, is a technique used to help prevent malicious code from running on a computer. DEP helps protect against specific types of attacks, such as code injection and cross-site scripting. Many penetration testing engagements require the use of DEP to mitigate potential risks. However, some tests may still require the execution of unprotected code to execute properly.
What is the Smartphone Pentest Framework?:A smartphone penetration testing framework is a software tool used by security auditors and hackers to test the vulnerabilities of mobile devices, typically smartphones. A typical penetration testing process begins with scanning for known exploits on target systems in order to identify any exploitable deficiencies. Once vulnerabilities have been identified, the attack surface can be analyzed to determine which areas may be vulnerable to exploitation. In many cases, forensic analysis will also be carried out in an attempt to locate sensitive data or evidence that could be used for criminal purposes should unauthorized access occur.
What is USSD Remote Control?:USSD Remote Control is an amazing tool that can be used during penetration testing. USSD Remote Control uses the unique signaling protocol of USSD over GPRS. This can be used to communicate with various devices over GPRS. The benefits of using USSD Remote Control in penetration testing are manifold. USSD Remote Control allows the penetration tester to control various devices remotely. This includes devices that are not always connected to the internet. USSD Remote Control is a very efficient tool and can be used to control a large number of devices. It also allows the penetration tester to perform various tasks remotely. For example, the penetration tester can use USSD Remote Control to scan devices for vulnerabilities.
What is EternalBlue SMB Remote Windows Kernel Pool Corruption?:EternalBlue exploits an SMB protocol memory corruption issue and allows attackers to gain control of vulnerable systems. This exploit can be used against both Server 2008 R2 SP1 and later versions, as well as Windows 10 Anniversary Update and earlier releases. EternalBlue has been exploited in attacks on Linux machines, macOS devices, Android phones/tablets, iOS devices (including the Apple Watch), routers, car drivers’ computers running firmware from Juniper Networks Inc., smart TVs from Sony Corp.
Explain Incognito attacks with Meterpreter?:An Incognito attack is an effective way to test the security of a system without the fear of being detected. By using Meterpreter to execute an Incognito attack, you can test the security of a system without the victim knowing about it.
What is Broken Access Control Vulnerability?:Broken access control is an attack vector used in penetration testing. It refers to the situation when an intruder gains unauthorized access to a system or network by exploiting a vulnerability that has been identified and fixed, but where some entry point remains unpatched. Broken Access Control (BAC) attacks can be carried out through exploit kits, phishing emails with embedded malicious attachments, weak passwords on systems and websites, social engineering tricks such as getting users to reveal their password on-demand or via chatbots, or even simple bypass of employee self-protection measures like two-factor authentication. 
Explain Cryptographic Failures in penetration testing?:Cryptographic failures are common in penetration testing. They can result in the compromise of sensitive information, as well as unauthorized access to systems. Lessons learned from cryptographic failures in penetration testing can be applied to avoid them in the future. Proper cryptography ensures that data transmissions are secure, preventing attackers from eavesdropping on or manipulating any messages being sent between two systems. Cryptographic failures in penetration tests can have serious consequences for organizations because they allow unauthorized individuals access to sensitive information and networks.
What is Insecure Design Vulnerability?:Insecure design vulnerability is a type of security vulnerability that can be found in web and application designs. These vulnerabilities make it possible for attackers to gain access to the system and exploit its weaknesses, which could result in data loss or other malicious activities. Website administrators are encouraged to use OWASP Top 10 Secure Coding Guidelines when designing their sites and applications, as these provide a basic foundation upon which more specific defensive measures may be layered.
What is a Security Misconfiguration vulnerability?:A security misconfiguration vulnerability in OWASP is an exposure of the organization’s sensitive information through a weakness in system configuration or user behavior. In general, any flaw that allows unauthorized access to data can be labeled as a security misconfiguration vulnerability. Examples include vulnerabilities found in web applications, networks, and even computer systems themselves. A common misconception among many organizations is that they are not at risk for breaches because their network protocols and application configurations are up-to-date. Any exposed service on your network could be exploited by malicious entities seeking to exploit known vulnerabilities for gainful purposes stealing proprietary data, breaching trust relationships with customers or employees, conducting denial-of-service attacks, etc.
What is an Outdated Component’s vulnerability?:A vulnerable component can be defined as any software or hardware element that might be used by an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in other components and access unauthorized data or systems. Any part of the architecture, design, implementation, operation, administration, or support of the organization could potentially become compromised if not properly protected against attacks. The aim of this paper is to provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of vulnerability concepts followed by providing some practical tips on how organizations can protect their critical infrastructure from cyber-attacks.
What is Identification and Authentication Failures vulnerability?:An identification and authentication failure vulnerability is a weakness in an identification or authentication process that allows unauthorized access to information. Identification and authentication failures vulnerabilities can be caused by tampering with the data, use of stolen credentials, or errors during user registration. In some cases, these weaknesses may also lead to fraudulent activities such as identity theft or credit card fraud.
What is Software and Data Integrity Failures vulnerability?:Software and data integrity failures vulnerability (SDF) is a type of security vulnerability that can occur when software or data are not properly protected from unauthorized access. SDFs arise when an attacker gains access to sensitive information, such as passwords or user account details, by exploiting one of the vulnerabilities in the system. When these confidential records are compromised, it could lead to serious consequences for the users involved. A breach involving personal data can have devastating effects on individuals’ careers and social lives.
What is Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability?:Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a vulnerability in web applications that allows an attacker to inject illegitimate requests into the application, resulting in unauthorized access or modification of data. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by tricking the user into submitting a specially crafted request to the server. SSRF attacks are typically used as part of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and can be very successful if executed against privileged accounts with admin rights on target websites.
What is Frame Injection vulnerability?:Frame injection vulnerability is a type of security flaw that allows an attacker to inject arbitrary frames into the flow of traffic passing through a website or application. This can be accomplished by injecting frames into the response sent from the server to the browser, or by manipulating elements in an HTTP request header. Frames are small pieces of HTML or XML that make up document content and are displayed within a web page as if they were part of the document itself. By inserting malicious frames into these responses, attackers may be able to inject code directly onto websites and applications users’ screens-causing them serious personal loss of injury, data theft, and even loss of revenue for businesses online.
What is URL Redirection vulnerability?:URL Redirection vulnerability is a type of security vulnerability that allows an attacker to redirect the user’s browser to a different website than was intended. This attack can be performed by tricking the victim into clicking on a malicious link or opening an illegitimate file. Redirections may also occur when users attempt to access pages that have been moved from their original location, due not only to human error but also to intentional manipulation by hackers and/or cybercriminals. URL redirection vulnerabilities are often used in malware attacks because they allow attackers to install infected files on targeted machines without the user ever knowing about it. You can also refer to the article Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards.
What is penetration testing dropbox?:Penetration testing dropbox is a security tool that can be used by security professionals to collect logs, artifacts, and other information from targets. It is important to note that the penetration testing dropbox is not a vulnerability scanner. Instead, it collects and stores data related to the target machines and applications. This data can be used to conduct further penetration tests on the target machines.
Explain How Data is Protected During and after Penetration Testing?:Security professionals refer to data protection as its own discipline unto itself – protecting confidential personal information, sensitive company files, and secure network communications. Protecting data involves ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility. Confidentiality ensures that data is kept secret from unauthorized parties who might try to steal or otherwise misappropriate the information, either personally or via the organization. Information security specialists have traditionally protected systems using access controls, firewalls, passwords, encryption/decryption techniques, intrusion detection software, etc.
Explain How Risk Analysis and Penetration Testing Are Different from Each Other?:Risk Analysis and Penetration Testing are both important aspects of information security, however, they have some key differences. Risk Analysis is the process of identifying, quantifying, and assessing the potential risks associated with a security vulnerability, system, or process. Penetration Testing is the process of testing a system’s vulnerability to attack by trying to exploit discovered vulnerabilities. Penetration Testing can be used to find vulnerabilities that could be harmful if exploited.
Does Penetration Testing Break a System?:In a penetration testing scenario, an exploit may be used to gain access to a system or to elevate privileges on the system. This may then be used to explore the target system in order to identify other vulnerabilities. Once vulnerabilities have been identified, penetration testers often use them to exploit systems to further assess the level of risk involved.
Why Should Penetration Testing Be Carried out by a Third Party?:When it comes to security, many organizations have a tendency of neglecting the perimeter. While this is understandable in the vast majority of cases, due to breaches that often originate from outside sources such as phishing and malware attacks, failing to properly secure your internal network can be shut down. A third-party penetration testing firm can help alleviate some of these problems by providing reliable and accurate information about vulnerabilities present in your organization’s systems or networks. Additionally, they can provide guidance on how best to address them – whether through vulnerability assessment or remediation.
What Are the Legal Steps Involved in Penetration Testing?:There are many different types of tests that a penetration tester might do. These include: Vulnerability scanning is the practice of scanning systems for potentially exploitable vulnerabilities; IQ scanning is the use of intrusive and often automated methods to determine the security of systems; Social engineering is the practice of exploiting human factors to gain access to systems; Physical access is the attempt to gain unauthorized access to systems through direct or remote access.
Can Penetration Testing Be Automated?:One of the key challenges in Penetration Testing is automated scanning and gathering of data. And this is where automation comes into the picture. Automation allows a penetration tester to automate the tasks that help in data gathering. This way, data is captured and analyzed in a systematic and efficient manner. Automation also allows for a quicker turnaround of reports, as well as saves time, and manpower.
What are the commonly targeted ports during penetration testing?:FTP (port 20, 21); SSH (port 22); Telnet (port 23); SMTP (port 25); HTTP (port 80); NTP (port 123); HTTPS (port 443)
What kind of penetration testing can be done with Diffie Hellman exchange?:DH exchange (Diffie-Hellman Exchange) is a cryptographic protocol that is used to create secure communications. It uses the same key every time two communicating parties use it to encrypt data. The protocol is named after two mathematicians, named Diffie and Hellman. The protocol works by generating two public keys and two secret keys. The public keys are made available to anyone who wants to send secure messages to the corresponding secret keys.
What are the Methods of detecting and defending against Rootkits?:How do you detect a rootkit: There is no single detection method that is guaranteed to work for every rootkit. However, some common methods used to detect a rootkit include scans with anti-malware programs, looking for unusual program behavior, and checking for modified files. How do you protect yourself from a rootkit attack:There is no foolproof way to prevent a rootkit attack, but there are several steps that can be taken to protect oneself. These steps include ensuring that the computer is installed with up-to-date antivirus software, not downloading unknown software, and using caution when using unknown or unverified applications.
What is Hail Mary function (Armitage) in penetration Testing?:The hail Mary function can be used in penetration testing to move files or streams to and from servers. The hail Mary function can be used to perform a variety of tasks, such as copying files, transferring files over a network, authenticating to a server, moving files to and from a target, and performing other tasks. 
What are the functions of a full-fledged Windows Rootkit?:A Windows Rootkit is a type of malware that infects and runs undetected within the Operating System (OS) of a computer. Once installed, it allows the creator or installer to perform various tasks on behalf of the rootkits’ user without being detected by normal security measures. A full-fledged Windows Rootkit can allow hackers access to sensitive information like passwords, banking details, emails, and other personal data stored on the infected machine.
What are the functions of the Java applet popup in penetration testing?:The process of creating a Java applet popup is simple. First, the tester must create a Java program that will be used as the popup. Next, the tester must create a file with the .html extension and place it in the same directory as the Java program. The file must have the same name as the Java program, but with the .html extension. The file should be divided into two parts. The first part contains the code that will be used to create the Java applet popup, and the second part contains the HTML code that will be used to display the Java applet popup.
What is Information Security?:In simple words, Information Security is the practice to secure information from any unauthorized access. ISO/IEC 27000 defined this term as "Preservation of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. Note: Also, other properties, such as authenticity, accountability, non-repudiation, and reliability, can also be involved."
What is the importance of A Penetration Test?:Penetration Testing is important for identifying vulnerabilities in an IT system from outside the network. Generally, it is an activity done after vulnerability assessment. In simple words, you can say, by doing Penetration testing, security analysts are attempting to gain access to resources without knowledge of usernames, passwords, and other normal means of access. You can only differentiate hackers from security experts is the permission given by the organization.
What are the phases of Network Penetration?:Penetration testing activity may be divided into 5 phases: Phase 1 – Reconnaissance. It is a process of collecting data about the target. It can be performed actively or passively. In this phase, you learn more and more about the target business and its operation. Activities include identifying the target, finding out the target IP address range, network, domain name, mail server, DNS records, etc. Phase 2 – Scanning. This is another crucial phase of penetration testing. In this phase, scanning has been done to identify vulnerabilities in the network and software and OS used by devices. After this activity, the pen tester learns about services running, open ports, firewall detection, vulnerabilities, OS, etc. There are a lot of tools available, both open-source and paid. Phase 3 – Gaining Access. In this phase, the pen tester started executing the attack by gaining access to vulnerable devices and servers. This can be done by using tools. Phase 4 – Maintaining Access. As a pen tester already gained access to a vulnerable system, in this phase, he/she tries to extract as much data and also remain stealthy. Phase 5 – Covering Tracks. In this phase, the pen tester takes all the necessary steps to hide the intrusion and possible controls left behind for future visits. He/she also removes all kinds of logs, uploaded backdoor(s), and anything related to the attack.
What is XSS or Cross-Site Scripting?:As explained by OWASP, "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in a browser-side script, to a different end-user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it."
What is the difference between asymmetric and symmetric encryption?:The major difference between symmetric and asymmetric cryptography is the number of secret keys. In the case of symmetric cryptography, only a single key is used for encryption and decryption. While in the case of asymmetric cryptography, the use of public and private keys are used for encryption and decryption.
What is “Vulnerability”?:Vulnerability is a term that every information security expert wants to eradicate from the IT system. In simple terms, vulnerability is a weakness in a system. If someone exploited those vulnerabilities, it might result in an intentional or unintentional compromise of a system.
Discuss a recent project of pen test which you have done.: To answer this question, you can start with the last project you have done in a pen test field. Also, mention your approach, which tools you have used, which vulnerabilities you have found, and how you help the developer fix those issues.
What kind of penetration can be done with the Diffie Hellman exchange?:Diffie–Hellman key exchange (DH) is a method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel and was one of the first public-key protocols.
What type of tools are there out there for packet sniffing?:Packet Sniffing is a process of capturing network traffic and being able to see traffic on an entire network or only a certain segment of it with the help of a packet sniffing tool, depending on how the network switches are configured, placed, etc. The most popular packet sniffing tool available for free is Wireshark.
How will you protect the data during and after Penetration Testing?:Pen Tester specified a policy regarding the finding of user data while testing. The policy tells what to do if any data is encountered during and after testing. However, a Backup is a must to avoid any loss of data.
What is Intrusion Detection?:Intrusion Detection, as the name suggests, it protects IT infrastructure from any cyber attack.  It identifies security breaches from both outsides and within a network. Intrusion Detection performs a wide variety of functions, including monitoring and analyzing traffic, recognizing the pattern of attack, checking the integrity of files in servers, checking if any policy violation happens, etc.

What is SQL injection?:It is an attack in which an attacker inserts untrusted data in the application that results in revealing sensitive information about the database.
How does SSL/TLS work?:SSL/TLS layer ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data while it is transmitted from source to destination. Steps involved: The user initiates the connection by typing the website address. The browser initiates SSL/TLS communication by sending a message to the website’s server; The website's server sends the public key or certificate to the user's browser; User's browser checks for a public key or certificate. If it is ok, it creates a symmetric key and sends it back to the website's server. If the certificate is not ok, the communication fails; On receiving the symmetric key, the website's server sent the key and encrypted the requested data; The user's browser decrypts the content using a symmetric key, which completes the SSL/TLS handshake. The user can see content as now the connection is established.

Do you hire criminals for a pen test? Aren't former "black hats" the best penetration testers?:This interview question is related to ethics. You can hire a former "black hat" for penetration testing by doing proper verification checks. An organization can decide regarding the hiring of individuals based on company policies.
If we're already performing vulnerability scanning, why should we perform a penetration test?:A vulnerability scan generally identifies weaknesses based on vulnerability signatures available in the scanning tool. While penetration testing helps in identifying the extent of data loss and exposure on occurring of cyber attacks.
We received a Penetration Test proposal that was quoted significantly lower than other proposals we received - why is that?:Charges of penetration testing vary from company to company. Generally, the quotation of penetration testing charges is based on the salary of the security tester, charges of tools used, size of the project, etc. Also, some infosec organization charges less than others based on competition in the market.
How do you schedule a penetration test?:It is advisable to conduct penetration testing regularly or on changes in any hosting infrastructure. Also, refer to company policy for the periodicity of a security audit.
What is an example of a large pen test engagement you've performed?:Here, give information regarding the penetration testing projects which you have performed in your previous organization. You can also mention the major vulnerabilities and tools used that you have found.
How long does it take to perform a penetration test?:It depends on many factors such as the size of the project, the skill of the penetration tester, the technology used, etc. You may decide the timelines based on the experience of the pentester.
How much experience do you have performing penetration testing?:Here, you can mention your experience in performing penetration testing jobs.
Can a penetration test break any system?:Every system has some security vulnerability- it may be known or unknown that is discovered by security researchers. No system is foolproof so if proper penetration testing is performed, any system can be broken by the security analyst. If the system is more secure, the security analyst will take more time to break and vice-versa. Time may vary from some days to months.
What certifications do you have to perform penetration testing?:Certifications are just additional qualifications of a penetration tester. But certifications are not proof of the skills of the tester. Some professionals don't have any certification, but still, they are the best at their job.  Certifications that are beneficial for penetration testers are EC-Council Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP), and GIAC Exploit Researcher & Advanced Penetration Tester (GXPN).
My data is stored in the cloud. Why do I need a Penetration test?:Even if data is stored in the cloud, penetration testing is still essential to see whether your data is secure or not. Also, to check the effectiveness of controls, a penetration test is required.
What types of systems have you performed penetration testing on?:Penetration testing performed on servers, endpoints, web applications, mobile devices, wireless networks, network devices, cloud services, and other potential targets of exposure.
How often should an organization have a penetration test performed by a third party?:It depends on the criticality of the organization's data hosted on the system. If data is more sensitive, the penetration testing frequency should be higher and vice-versa.
Do penetration tests cause any disruption to an organization’s network?:It may disrupt services if the penetration tester successfully exploits the vulnerabilities. To minimize disruption, keep your client informed and also stop the testing if required.
Why is penetration testing important to an organization’s risk management strategy?:A risk management strategy is a process of identifying, accessing, and managing the risk in the system. Penetration testing is an assessment of the IT system from the perspective of a hacker. This activity gives confidence to management that the company's IT assets are secure.
Can you target any IP Address for penetration testing?:Penetration testing started only after a detailed discussion regarding targets with the management and technical team of the company. The legal agreement was also signed between the pen-testing agency and the company and mentioned all IP addresses that are in the scope of the test.
We have a firewall in place. Do we still need network penetration testing if we have a Firewall?:Firewall is used for analyzing traffic and blocks it based on predetermined configuration. While penetration testing checks for the exploitability of IT assets including the firewall. Penetration testing is a necessary activity even with all the network components in place.
Why should a third party assess your system?:Generally organizations have their security teams to manage cybersecurity-related operations. But still, third-party penetration testing is recommended to build confidence in management and take advantage of the experience of other organizations in identifying new vulnerabilities in the system.
Does Pentesting do social engineering?:Generally, social engineering is not in the scope of penetration testing.  But nowadays some organizations do consider the social engineering aspect while doing pen-testing.
Are Denial-of-service attacks also tested?:Denial-0f-service (DoS) attacks are also within the scope of penetration testing. Many tools are available to see whether the system is vulnerable to DoS attacks or not.
Why should not only the network perimeter be tested, but also the internal network?:Internal networks are also vulnerable to some type of attack. The scope shouldn't be just internet-facing servers, other internal servers also should be in scope for evaluation.
What time investment do you estimate for a Penetration Test?:Time estimate depends on the number of IT devices and experience of the tester, the time required for fixing security issues by developers, etc.
Are there legal requirements for Penetration Tests?:Penetration testing starts only when there is an agreement signed by the organization and pen testing agency. In an agreement, the list of targets explicitly mentioned which are the scope of pen-testing. Testers are advised not to test any other target outside the scope.
